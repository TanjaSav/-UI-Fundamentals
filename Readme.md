 Whitespace
 --
 Whitespace  is the space between graphics, columns, images, text, margins and other elements. It is the space left untouched in order to smooth things out and transform a page into something elegant.
 Line spacing as negative space. One way to apply micro negative space would be to use line spacing. Line spacing is just another negative space that is applied between the lines of a text. Line spacing is the space between 2 baselines of text lines.
 How do we know how much space between lines is enough?
 According to the web accessibility guidelines (wcag 2.0) the spacing between text lines should be at least 150% bigger then the font size. That means that we should almost never use the default text spacings defined for paragraphs and headings. Example, most browsers use 110% to 120% as default line spacing, Sketch and Adobe creative suite uses 120%, Bootstrap uses 142% of the font size defined and Medium 157% of line spacing to their main body text.


Alignment
--
Alignment helps to connect elements on a page to guide where the eye moves. These elements can be image, text, icons, graphic, shape, or illustrations. Alignment improves readability and content flow.
To be able to create a solid layout design, understanding Grid can be helpful. Grid system helps structure elements based on sequenced columns and rows.
There are 3 different types of alignment: left, center, and right.
Moving all the group of texts to the left allows images to occupy the right side of the design.
Right text alignment probably makes more sense for content that use languages with right to left scripts. This alignment can feel unnatural on body text if we read English or other languages that are derived from Latin, or left to right scripts. However, this is great to use on titles, short sentence, or big letters to create a dynamic layout.
Center alignment can make content look prominent or elegant, but it works best for headlines and short line of text.

Contrast
----
Contrast is the difference between two or more elements. 
There are a few ways to create contrast in the designs.
- There’s color contrast with using image overlays, which can create a clear contrast between a heading and a background. This method is a rather popular way for the hero section or to dramatize the main content or text.
- Sizing contrast will apply mostly to all design elements on the page. Typography schemes and visual content like headings, buttons, body paragraphs, menu elements, vector graphics, image collections, and such, all have their own information architecture. When a visitor lands on a website they are most likely to start reading the bigger letters (in the case of texts) assuming it’s the title. Only after that will they go over subheadings and body texts. It’s a simple way to introduce informational hierarchy (most important to less important) while helping the reader navigate through the content at the same time.
- To create contrast with spacing, most web designers will usually use negative space between or around elements. The emptiness around said element highlights the contrast between the design details surrounding it and the overall background.

Color
--
The mixture of all visible light is white light. White light is made up of all the colors in the rainbow. These colors are always in the same order and are called the Color Spectrum. When organized around a circle, the color spectrum is called a Color Wheel.

The primary colors are Red, Yellow and Blue in the art world. They are considered primary colors because they cannot be made from mixing other colors but they may be mixed to make most other colors. Black and white can also be added to create additional colors.
Secondary colors are Green, Orange and Violet (or Purple). They are the colors that result in mixing two of the Primary colors together in equal amounts
Intermediate colors are made by mixing a primary color with one of its two adjacent secondary colors. An adjacent color is one the is next to a color in the color spectrum. 

Color has three main properties: hue, value and intensity.
1. Hue is the name of a pure color, such as red, blue, or yellow.
2. Value is the lightness or darkness of a hue (color). The value of a hue can be changed by adding black or white. Light values of colors are called tints. Darker values of colors are called shades.
3. Intensity is the brightness or dullness of a hue (color). Pure hues are high-intensity colors. Dull hues are low-intensity colors. 
Intensity of color is changed by adding varying amounts of its complimentary color. For example, to make a bright green duller a little bit of red could be added to it.

Warm colors are colors that reming us of things that are warm: they are red, yellow and orange.
Cool colors remind us of things we associate with cold or coolness. They are blue, violet and green.

Scale
--
The typographic scale is used to create a balanced and friendly font sizing, which uses a range of type sizes related to each other since they grow by the same ratio. 
High Contrast Scales. Designs that demand a fair amount of contrast between types use high contrast and hugely benefit from Augmented Fourth, Perfect Fifth, and Golden Ratio. These can be a perfect fit for large screen devices.
Medium contrast can use The Major Third, Major Second, or Perfect Fourth scales as the contrast between types is not drastic and can fit more content.
Designs that should be versatile, such as dashboards and mobile apps, often use low-contrast scales as they allow the content to be flexible. Low contrast scales include Minor Second and Major Second.
Type scale that is responsive and feels more comfortable to read across multiple screen sizes is essential. 
Adding a second type scale allows to have more flexibility, making our type scale a little looser to allow well-defined type sizes for much higher contrast across different screen sizes.

Proximity
--
Principle of Proximity is based on the cognitive tendency to perceive the objects close to each other as related, especially in comparison with those which are placed farther. 
Items that are similar in nature should be grouped together visually. This makes the design look organized and easy to navigate. It emphasizes that items that are connected together should be kept separate.
Components with the same function, meaning, and hierarchical structure maintain the unity of styles so that users can quickly understand the operation of this component.
The size can also be used to indicate the signal relationship. Objects of similar size are likely to be considered related and usually have the same importance. The same size means the same visual prominence, and, when everything else is the same, connect all elements that share this attribute. Consistently use size to create a visual hierarchy and make the page easy to scan and split.

Typography
--
Typography is the technique and art of arranging type to make written language readable, legible and appealing when displayed or printed.
We all use font and typeface terms as synonyms. However, their meaning is different.
The font is a visual representation of text character introduced in one specific typeface, size, and weight. The typeface is a style of type design. It contains a complete scope of characters. This means all sizes and weights. This means that typeface is a collection that gathers many fonts.
There are several tips for better readability and legibility:
-	Pick one, max two Typefaces.
-	Use two, max three weights.
-	Avoid Black and Ultralight weights.
-	Hard to read? Experiment with tracking
-	Increase Line Spacing for a larger amount of content
-	Limit the line length to 70-80 characters.
-	Keep track of line spacing when changing fonts
-	Align big blocks of text to the Left
-	Do Not Justify
-	Use 16pt for Body Text

Visual Hierarchy
--
Visual Hierarchy is used to rank design elements. There are several principles that used in design: that help influence the navigation of the content.
1. Reading patterns.
All cultures read from the top down and most cultures read from left to right. People first scan a page to get a sense of whether they are interested, before committing to read it. Scanning patterns tend to take one of two shapes, “F” and “Z,”.
- F-patterns apply to traditional, text-heavy pages like articles or blog posts. A reader scans down the left side of the page, looking for interesting key words in left-aligned headings or initial topic sentences, then stopping and reading (to the right) when he or she comes to something interesting. The result looks something like an F (or E, or something with even more horizontal bars; but the “F” term has stuck).
- Z-patterns apply to other sorts of pages, like ads or websites, where information is not necessarily presented in block paragraphs. A reader’s eye first scans across the top of the page, where important information is likely to be found, then shoots down to the opposite corner at a diagonal and does the same thing across the lower part of the page.
Web designers commonly construct their pages to conform explicitly to this behavior, placing the most important information in the corners and orienting other important information along the top and bottom bars and connecting diagonal.
2. Size matters. This one is simple enough: people read bigger things first.
3. Space and texture. Another way of drawing attention is to give content ample room to breathe. If there is substantial negative space left around a button, or the lines in a text block are widely tracked, these elements will be more readily visible to readers.
4. Typeface weight and pairing
Typeface selection is critical to establishing visual hierarchy. Among a typeface’s most important attributes are weight – the width of the strokes that compose its letters – and style, like serif and sans serif. Other modifications like italicization can play a role too.
5. Color and tint. Here’s another no-brainer: bright colors stand out from muted colors or grayscale, while lighter tints appear more “distant” and thus fall lower on the hierarchy than richer, darker ones.
6. Direction. Page layouts are typically designed according to a grid of vertical and horizontal lines, both by convention and because this is the most legible format. In such a system, a new way to establish hierarchy emerges: break the grid.
